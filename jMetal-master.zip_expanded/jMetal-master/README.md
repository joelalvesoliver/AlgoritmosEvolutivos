# jMetal 5 Development Site

### Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jMetal/jMetal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jMetal/jMetal)

**jMetal** is an object-oriented Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics
The Web page of the project is: [http://jmetal.github.io/jMetal/](http://jmetal.github.io/jMetal/). Former jMetal versions can be found in [SourceForge](http://jmetal.sourceforge.net). The current version is jMetal 5.4. 

The jMetal development version is hosted in this repository; this way, interested users can take a look to
the new incoming features in advance.

If you are interested in contributing with your ideas and comments, please take a look the current discussions in the [Issues section](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/issues).

## Changelog of the next incoming release (jMetal 5.5)

### Algorithms

* Improvements in algorithms [WASF-GA](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/tree/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/wasfga) and [GWASF-GA](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/tree/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/gwasfga). Contribution of Rub√©n Saborido.
* Algorithm MOEA/D and variants can now return a subset of evenly distributed solutions (see Miscelanea)
* Algorithm [ESPEA](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/tree/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/espea). Contribution of Marlon Braun.
* Algorithm [CDG-MOEA](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/cdg/CDG.java). Contribution of Feng Zhang and Xinye Cai.

### Problems
* Problems of the [CEC 2018 competition on many-objective optimization](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/tree/master/jmetal-problem/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/problem/multiobjective/maf). Contribution of Gian Mauricio Fritsche.

### Miscelanea

* Added class [KNearestNeighborhood](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-core/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/util/neighborhood/impl/KNearestNeighborhood.java). 
* Added new neighborhood classes: C25, C49, L13, L25 and L41 (https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/tree/master/jmetal-core/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/util/neighborhood/impl).
* Added method `getSubsetOfEvenlyDistributedSolutions()` to class [MOEADUtils](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/blob/master/jmetal-algorithm/src/main/java/org/uma/jmetal/algorithm/multiobjective/moead/util/MOEADUtils.java).

### Bugs
* Fixed a bug in the component of the experiment package that executes the algorithms in parallel. All the experiment classes in package jmetal-exec have been updated.
* Fixed a bug in the experiment framework which led to recompute quality indicators more times than needed.
* Fixed a bug in class `AbstractGenericSolution` caused by solutions stored as attributes. This issue might lead to infinite recursive calls when two solutions are compared.
